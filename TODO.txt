Spacecraft
SpaceManiac Minecraft Server

To-Do List
(In approximate order of importance)

Bugs and important features:
	Water doesn't appear at the map edge
	'mode' option in map header (8 bytes)
		> 'creative' for no-frills normal map
		> 'create+ ' for normal map + special blocks
		> 'mining  ' for mining-game mode (maybe?)
		> other stuff?
	Proper mod/op list
		suggested levels: guest, builder, mod, admin
		guest - place & destroy, /me. no other commands
		builder - teleport(?), use certain other commands eventually like placing special blocks
		mod - kick, ban, etc. maybe swap map if there's not an admin around
		admin - do owner-type things like shut down the server or swap map or whatever (reserved for person with physical access to the server)
	Something else I'm forgetting, I'm sure

Potential future features:
	Private messaging
	Robot class is sort of a skeleton for an NPC character
	Conveyor belt of some sort
	Block that attacts water upwards
	Balloons that float up
