2010/05/02 17:15:00	SpaceManiac: Cool owl.
2010/05/02 17:15:13	Lim_Dul: SWASTIKAS, NAO
2010/05/02 17:15:14	SpaceManiac: bear.
2010/05/02 17:15:14	SpaceManiac: no, please.
2010/05/02 17:15:19	darkguyhades: lolwut
2010/05/02 17:15:22	Lim_Dul: Kidding
2010/05/02 17:15:49	Lim_Dul: So, what cool stuff can I use?
2010/05/02 17:15:54	SpaceManiac: Not a whole lot
2010/05/02 17:16:00	SpaceManiac: The main easily visible thing is the water
2010/05/02 17:16:01	Lim_Dul: And why is Pyro Pyro
2010/05/02 17:16:08	Lim_Dul: Running around in a circle?
2010/05/02 17:16:13	SpaceManiac: that's a test mob :P
2010/05/02 17:16:16	SpaceManiac: here
2010/05/02 17:16:19	Spawning mob Lim_Dul
2010/05/02 17:16:21	Lim_Dul: Ah :-P
2010/05/02 17:16:24	SpaceManiac: now you're running in circles
2010/05/02 17:16:36	SpaceManiac: they move around over time
2010/05/02 17:16:41	SpaceManiac: not totally sure why ;)
2010/05/02 17:16:49	SpaceManiac: probably floating point rounding in the timer
2010/05/02 17:17:04	Lim_Dul: Well
2010/05/02 17:17:08	Lim_Dul: At least it works :-P
2010/05/02 17:17:12	Lim_Dul: Planning multiworld?
2010/05/02 17:17:31	SpaceManiac: Yeah, eventually.
2010/05/02 17:17:32	Yellow_Wizard: why does anything with a jar file error when i tr
2010/05/02 17:17:36	SpaceManiac: Code needs a lot of cleanup first
2010/05/02 17:17:38	Yellow_Wizard: y to open it
2010/05/02 17:17:45	Cliffy1000: Back to underground tunneling I suppose
2010/05/02 17:17:48	SpaceManiac: You should probably reinstall java
2010/05/02 17:17:55	Lim_Dul: OK, bye
2010/05/02 17:17:55	darkguyhades: No wait
2010/05/02 17:18:01	Lim_Dul: Oooh
2010/05/02 17:18:04	Lim_Dul: Water physics work
2010/05/02 17:18:07	SpaceManiac: yeah.
2010/05/02 17:18:12	SpaceManiac: it's somewhat unique
2010/05/02 17:18:27	SpaceManiac: as you can see
2010/05/02 17:18:30	SpaceManiac: less destructive
2010/05/02 17:18:42	Lim_Dul: Semi-finite
2010/05/02 17:18:48	SpaceManiac: yep.
2010/05/02 17:18:55	Rumia: so, how to "place" water?
2010/05/02 17:19:03	SpaceManiac: requires higher level
2010/05/02 17:19:06	SpaceManiac: Mod
2010/05/02 17:19:09	SpaceManiac: or higher
2010/05/02 17:19:13	Cliffy1000: It made skytown so much less-des- *shot*
2010/05/02 17:19:33	Lim_Dul: So you almost made
2010/05/02 17:19:44	Lim_Dul: Like proper real world water physics
2010/05/02 17:19:44	Cliffy1000: oops, no hyphen/dash there
2010/05/02 17:19:44	SpaceManiac: yeah
2010/05/02 17:19:46	SpaceManiac: almost
2010/05/02 17:19:49	Lim_Dul: I wish some server software did that :-D
2010/05/02 17:19:51	Lim_Dul: Like
2010/05/02 17:19:53	Cliffy1000: oh great
2010/05/02 17:19:55	SpaceManiac: well now Spacecraft does :D
2010/05/02 17:19:59	Lim_Dul: With pressure calculations :-P
2010/05/02 17:20:01	SpaceManiac: sorry cliffy :(
2010/05/02 17:20:10	Lim_Dul: Like when you have a tower of water
2010/05/02 17:20:11	SpaceManiac: Lim_Dul did it! D:
2010/05/02 17:20:19	Cliffy1000: D:
2010/05/02 17:20:23	Lim_Dul: I wanted to check water :-P
2010/05/02 17:20:25	SpaceManiac: :P
2010/05/02 17:20:30	SpaceManiac: don't worry too much cliffy
2010/05/02 17:20:30	Lim_Dul: Since Cat talked about it :-P
2010/05/02 17:20:32	Lim_Dul: And I found a hole
2010/05/02 17:20:33	SpaceManiac: yeah.
2010/05/02 17:20:36	SpaceManiac: it's fine
2010/05/02 17:20:39	Lim_Dul: So I used it :-D
2010/05/02 17:21:28	Cliffy1000: You can go up those stairs
2010/05/02 17:21:32	Cliffy1000: But
2010/05/02 17:21:36	Yellow_Wizard: BISCUTS AND GRAVAY
2010/05/02 17:21:42	Cliffy1000: Lava is spongeable here

2010/05/02 17:21:52	SpaceManiac: oh, yeah.
2010/05/02 17:21:56	SpaceManiac: Lava is spongeable.
